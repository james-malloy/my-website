Yesterday (January 30th) marked my 33rd birthday or my "JC" year as they call it. Why "JC"? A [credible source](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jesus%20year) describes the JC Year as such: 

<blockquote>

"The year that Jesus Christ died. The 33rd year of your life where you are reborn in some sense. Perhaps a mid-life crisis, perhaps an ego death, perhaps the year where you abandon old ways and start new."

</blockquote>

On the one hand, embracing a "Jesus Year" can seem a bit cryptic, ¿no?  Turning 33 just to be betrayed by 1 out of every 6 friends and crucified isn't really how I see myself going out. However, unlike Jesus I have zero intentions of atoning for anyone else's sin. I haven't even atoned for a traffic ticket I got over 30 days ago ️<img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/160/apple/285/man-facepalming-medium-dark-skin-tone_1f926-1f3fe-200d-2642-fe0f.png" width="15" height="15">.

On the other hand, perhaps there's something more to be gleaned from the Jesus Year. Something allegorical with meaning and inspiration. After all, with the _______________. But I will try something else "revolutionary" and share a bit of my world through blogging. 
 
All that being said, welcome one, welcome all to my newly minted blog. What will I write about? Everything basically. You can read about my thoughts and random goings-on in the blog section of my site. Projects is the section dedicated to showcasing finished products I create typically with a data or research focus. Lastly, the section "Learn with me" is where I'll share steps and how-tos of things I'm either learning in school or self-teaching between class.

Thanks everyone for the many birthday wishes yesterday and up to now. They're all much appreciated. Now excuse me while I go pay for my high crimes to the state of Georgia Department of Driver Services.

~ Happy birthday to me,

  James

### The JC Year

Yesterday (January 30th) marked my 33rd birthday or my "JC Year" as some call it. What's a "JC Year"? <br> [A credible source](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jesus%20year) defines it as...

<blockquote>

"The year that Jesus Christ ("JC") died...The 33rd year of your life where you are reborn in some sense. Perhaps a mid-life crisis, perhaps an ego death, perhaps the year where you abandon old ways and start new."

</blockquote>

On the one hand, embracing a "JC Year" feels a bit cryptic, ¿no? I mean, betrayal by 1 out of every 6 friends...AND crucifixion by age 33?! That isn't really how I wanna go out. Lucky for me, I don't think I even have 6 friends (much less 12) to do unto me as Peter and Judas did unto Jesus. 

Also, unlike Jesus, I have 0 intention of paying the ultimate price for anyone's sin. I don't even wanna pay for the $250 traffic ticket I got the other day. I'm drawing a hard line in the sand at atoning for the sins of mankind. 

Death and peril aside, I'd say there's something more to be gleaned from the metaphorical "JC Year". Something intimidating, yet also inspiring. If by age 33 Jesus could carpenter by <i class="far fa-sun"></i> and start a revolution against the Roman Empire by <i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i>, then I can at least share my failed DIY projects and attempts to undermine the wicked empire at Great Lakes. 
 
That being said, welcome one and all to my newly minted website. What will it be about? Basically everything. The [BLOG](https://www.jamesmalloy.net/blog/) section will be a dedicated space to warehouse my thoughts and the random goings-on in my life. [PROJECTS](https://www.jamesmalloy.net/project/) will showcase final versions of products I create typically with a data or research focus. Lastly, the section titled [LEARN WITH ME](http://localhost:4321/learnwithme/) will be true to its name, giving me the opportunity to share things I'm still learning, mistakes and all.

Thanks everyone for the many birthday wishes yesterday and up to now. They're all much appreciated. Now excuse me while I log off to go pay for my high crimes against the State of Georgia Department of Driver Services️. <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/160/apple/285/man-facepalming-medium-dark-skin-tone_1f926-1f3fe-200d-2642-fe0f.png" width="15" height="15">

Until the next post.

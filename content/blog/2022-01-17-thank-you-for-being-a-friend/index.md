### Test

I read somewhere the other day a question that asked:

<blockquote>

Question: "How do you know you've left an indelible mark on society?" 

Answer: "When the world collectively agrees that your 100-year lifespan wasn't 
    <sp>long enough." 
 
</blockquote>

I don't know about y'all, but I could definitely do another 100 years of having Betty White around.

And while I'd say my own humor rivals moreso that of Dorothy's, I'd like to think that my values are in the likeness of Rose. I appreciate Betty White for bringing a 

"Yes, I may be slower than you, but maybe I'm worth waiting for." 



I was on the Betty White bandwagon before it was trendy. (And I say that realizing I get absolutely 0 cool points it). But that's how serious I mean it. I grew up watching Golden Girls when I was just a little boy. I'd be in my mom's room watching tv soaking up every joke and every crack. And while my own humor mirrored Dorothy's more than anyone's, Rose always stood out as my favorite. I appreciate Betty White for bringing a 

"Yes, I may be slower than you, but maybe I'm worth waiting for." 

And just like clock work, I waited up at night to catch Rose and the girls. Years have passed and habits have changed but this is one Jamesism I'll probably carry on to the bitter end.

I'm so appreciate of Betty White for her portrayal in the Golden Girls and her career in general. Like most people, I've had my fair share of reasons not to laught. I'm grateful to Betty White for giving me so many opportunities to laugh when life gave me so many reasons to do anything but. 

So this post is dedicated to you, Betty. Your life and your art have inspired the masses. And you've inspired me to do the same.
